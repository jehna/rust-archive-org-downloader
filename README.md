# Rust Archive.org Downloader
> A toolkit for downloading and processing archive.org data

This project uses streaming to download and process archive.org data. It is easy
on the processor and memory, so you can run through enormous amounts of data
relatively quickly.

## Getting started

You can find the tools from `src/bin/` directory. Start by running:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

This will build the binary files to `target/release/`. You can then run the
programs from there:

```shell
./target/release/link_shortener_urls --help
./target/release/download_pastebin --help
```

This will print out the help for the programs.

## Features

This project is a personal toolkit that probably requires some Rust knowledge to
run. The best parts:
* It works
* It's fast (a few hours to parse all pastebin data)
* Parallel processing (did I say it's fast?)
* No error handling â€“ catastrophic failures on network hiccups (good for people
  who like to live dangerously)
* Hopefully gets me some edge finding bug bounties

## Contributing
